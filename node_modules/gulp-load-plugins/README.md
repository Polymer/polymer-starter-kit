# gulp-load-plugins

[![npm](https://nodei.co/npm/gulp-load-plugins.svg?downloads=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/gulp-load-plugins/)

> Loads in any gulp plugins and attaches them to the global scope, or an object of your choice.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jackfranklin/gulp-load-plugins.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jackfranklin/gulp-load-plugins)


## Install

```sh
$ npm install --save-dev gulp-load-plugins
```


## Usage

Given a `package.json` file that has some dependencies within:

```json
{
    "dependencies": {
        "gulp-jshint": "*",
        "gulp-concat": "*"
    }
}
```

Adding this into your `Gulpfile.js`:

```js
var gulp = require('gulp');
var gulpLoadPlugins = require('gulp-load-plugins');
var plugins = gulpLoadPlugins();
```

Or, even shorter:

```js
var plugins = require('gulp-load-plugins')();
```

Will result in the following happening (roughly, plugins are lazy loaded but in practice you won't notice any difference):

```js
plugins.jshint = require('gulp-jshint');
plugins.concat = require('gulp-concat');
```

You can then use the plugins just like you would if you'd manually required them, but referring to them as `plugins.name()`, rather than just `name()`.

This frees you up from having to manually require each gulp plugin.

## Options

You can pass in an object of options that are shown below: (the values for the keys are the defaults):

```js
gulpLoadPlugins({
    DEBUG: false, // when set to true, the plugin will log info to console. Useful for bug reporting and issue debugging
    pattern: ['gulp-*', 'gulp.*'], // the glob(s) to search for
    config: 'package.json', // where to find the plugins, by default searched up from process.cwd()
    scope: ['dependencies', 'devDependencies', 'peerDependencies'], // which keys in the config to look within
    replaceString: /^gulp(-|\.)/, // what to remove from the name of the module when adding it to the context
    camelize: true, // if true, transforms hyphenated plugins names to camel case
    lazy: true, // whether the plugins should be lazy loaded on demand
    rename: {}, // a mapping of plugins to rename
    renameFn: function (name) { ... } // a function to handle the renaming of plugins (the default works)
});
```

## Renaming

From 0.8.0, you can pass in an object of mappings for renaming plugins. For example, imagine you want to load the `gulp-ruby-sass` plugin, but want to refer to it as just `sass`:

```js
gulpLoadPlugins({
  rename: {
    'gulp-ruby-sass': 'sass'
  }
});
```

Note that if you specify the `renameFn` options with your own custom rename function, while the `rename` option will still work, the `replaceString` and `camelize` options will be ignored.

## npm Scopes

`gulp-load-plugins` comes with [npm scope](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scope) support. The major difference is that scoped plugins are accessible through an object on `plugins` that represents the scope. For example, if the plugin is `@myco/gulp-test-plugin` then you can access the plugin as shown in the following example:

```js
var plugins = require('gulp-load-plugins')();

plugins.myco.testPlugin();
```

## Lazy Loading

In 0.4.0 and prior, lazy loading used to only work with plugins that return a function. In newer versions though, lazy loading should work for any plugin. If you have a problem related to this please try disabling lazy loading and see if that fixes it. Feel free to open an issue on this repo too.


## Credit

Credit largely goes to @sindresorhus for his [load-grunt-plugins](https://github.com/sindresorhus/load-grunt-tasks) plugin. This plugin is almost identical, just tweaked slightly to work with Gulp and to expose the required plugins.


## Changelog

##### 1.2
- throw an error if two packages are loaded that end up having the same name after the `replaceString` has been removed - thanks @carloshpds

##### 1.1
- added `DEBUG` option to turn on logging and help us debug issues - thanks @dcamilleri


##### 1.0.0
- added `renameFn` function to give users complete control over the name a plugin should be given when loaded - thanks @callumacrae

##### 1.0.0-rc.1
- This is the first release candidate for what will become version 1 of gulp-load-plugins. Once a fix for [#70](https://github.com/jackfranklin/gulp-load-plugins/issues/70) is landed, I plan to release V1.
- **Breaking Change** support for `NODE_PATH` is no longer supported. It was causing complexities and in [the PR that droppped support](https://github.com/jackfranklin/gulp-load-plugins/pull/75) no one shouted that they required `NODE_PATH` support.

##### 0.10.0
- throw a more informative error if a plugin is loaded that gulp-load-plugins can't find. [PR](https://github.com/jackfranklin/gulp-load-plugins/pull/68) - thanks @connor4312
- allow `require` to look on the `NODE_PATH` if it can't find the module in the working directory. [PR](https://github.com/jackfranklin/gulp-load-plugins/pull/69) - thanks @chmanie

##### 0.9.0
- add support for npm-scoped plugins. [PR](https://github.com/jackfranklin/gulp-load-plugins/pull/63) - thanks @hbetts

##### 0.8.1
- fixed a bug where gulp-load-plugins would use the right `package.json` file but the wrong `node_modules` directory - thanks @callumacrae

##### 0.8.0
- add the ability to rename plugins that gulp-load-plugins loads in.

##### 0.7.1
- add `files` property to package.json so only required files are downloaded when installed - thanks @shinnn


##### 0.7.0
- support loading plugins with a dot in the name, such as `gulp.spritesmith` - thanks to @MRuy
- upgrade multimatch to 1.0.0


##### 0.6.0
- Fix issues around plugin picking wrong package.json file - thanks @iliakan (see [issue](https://github.com/jackfranklin/gulp-load-plugins/issues/35)).

##### 0.5.3
- Show a nicer error if the plugin is unable to load any configuration and hence can't find any dependencies to load

##### 0.5.2
- Swap out globule for multimatch, thanks @sindresorhus.

##### 0.5.1
- Updated some internal dependencies which should see some small improvements - thanks @shinnn for this contribution.

##### 0.5.0
- improved lazy loading so it should work with plugins that don't just return a function. Thanks to @nfroidure for help with this.

##### 0.4.0
- plugins are lazy loaded for performance benefit. Thanks @julien-f for this.

##### 0.3.0
- turn the `camelize` option on by default

##### 0.2.0
- added `camelize` option, thanks @kombucha.
- renamed to `gulp-load-plugins`.

##### 0.1.1
- add link to this repository into `package.json` (thanks @ben-eb).

##### 0.1.0
- move to `gulpLoadplugins` returning an object with the tasks define.

##### 0.0.5
- added `replaceString` option to configure exactly what gets replace when the plugin adds the module to the context

##### 0.0.4
- fixed keyword typo so plugin appears in search for gulp plugins

##### 0.0.3
- removed accidental console.log I'd left in

##### 0.0.2
- fixed accidentally missing a dependency out of package.json

##### 0.0.1
- initial release
