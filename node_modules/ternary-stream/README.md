ternary-stream ![status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/robrich/ternary-stream.png?branch=master)
=======

A ternary stream: conditionally control the flow of stream data

## Usage

1: Conditionally filter content

**Condition**

![][condition]

if the condition returns truthy, data is piped to the child stream

```js
var ternaryStream = require('ternary-stream');

var condition = function (data) {
  return true;
};

process.stdin
  .pipe(ternaryStream(condition, process.stdout))
  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('./out.txt'));
});
```

Data will conditionally go to stdout, and always go to the file

2: Ternary stream

**Ternary**

![][ternary]


```javascript
var ternaryStream = require('ternary-stream');
var through2 = require('through2');

var count = 0;
var condition = function (data) {
  count++;
  return count % 2;
};

process.stdin
  .pipe(ternaryStream(condition, fs.createWriteStream('./truthy.txt'), fs.createWriteStream('./falsey.txt')))
  .pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

Data will either go to truthy.txt (if condition is true) or falsey.txt (if condition is false) and will always go to stdout

## API

### ternaryStream(condition, stream [, elseStream])

ternary-stream will pipe data to `stream` whenever `condition` is truthy.

If `condition` is falsey and `elseStream` is passed, data will pipe to `elseStream`.

After data is piped to `stream` or `elseStream` or neither, data is piped down-stream.

#### Parameters

##### condition

Type: `function`: takes in stream data and returns `boolean`

```js
function (data) {
	return true; // or false
}
```

##### stream

Stream for ternary-stream to pipe data into when condition is truthy.

##### elseStream

Optional, Stream for ternary-stream to pipe data into when condition is falsey.
