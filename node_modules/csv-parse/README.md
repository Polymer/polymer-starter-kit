[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/wdavidw/node-csv-parse.png)][travis]

Part of the [CSV module][csv_home], this project is a parser converting CSV text
input into arrays or objects. It implements the Node.js
[`stream.Transform` API][stream_transform]. It also provides a simple
callback-based API for convenience. It is both extremely easy to use and
powerful. It was first released in 2010 and is used against big data sets by a
large community.

[Documentation for the "csv-parse" package is available here][home].
