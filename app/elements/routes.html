<!--
The first thing any document using more-routing must do is configure the driver.

more-routing supports path (`/foo/bar`) and hash (`#!/foo/bar`) style routes.
-->
<more-routing-config driver="hash"></more-routing-config>

<!--
You can name routes.

It is strongly recommended that you declare all your named routes in an import
such as this, as it acts as a reference for your application, and makes nesting
more clear.
-->
<more-route name="home" path="/"></more-route>
<more-route name="users" path="/users">
  <more-route name="user-info" path="/:name"></more-route>
</more-route>
<more-route name="contact" path="/contact"></more-route>
