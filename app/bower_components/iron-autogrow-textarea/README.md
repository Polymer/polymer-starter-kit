##&lt;iron-autogrow-textarea&gt;

`iron-autogrow-textarea` is an element containing a textarea that grows in height as more
lines of input are entered. Unless an explicit height or the `maxRows` property is set, it will
never scroll.

Example:

```html
<iron-autogrow-textarea></iron-autogrow-textarea>
```

Because the `textarea`'s `value` property is not observable, you should use
this element's `bind-value` instead for imperative updates.

### Styling

The following custom properties and mixins are available for styling:

| Custom property | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--iron-autogrow-textarea` | Mixin applied to the textarea | `{}` |
| `--iron-autogrow-textarea-placeholder` | Mixin applied to the textarea placeholder | `{}` |
