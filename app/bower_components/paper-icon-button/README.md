##&lt;paper-icon-button&gt;

Material design: [Icon toggles](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/buttons.html#buttons-toggle-buttons)

`paper-icon-button` is a button with an image placed at the center. When the user touches
the button, a ripple effect emanates from the center of the button.

`paper-icon-button` includes a default icon set.  Use `icon` to specify which icon
from the icon set to use.

```html
<paper-icon-button icon="menu"></paper-icon-button>
```

See [`iron-iconset`](iron-iconset) for more information about
how to use a custom icon set.

Example:

```html
<link href="path/to/iron-icons/iron-icons.html" rel="import">

<paper-icon-button icon="favorite"></paper-icon-button>
<paper-icon-button src="star.png"></paper-icon-button>
```

To use `paper-icon-button` as a link, wrap it in an anchor tag. Since `paper-icon-button`
will already receive focus, you may want to prevent the anchor tag from receiving focus
as well by setting its tabindex to -1.

```html
<a href="https://www.polymer-project.org" tabindex="-1">
  <paper-icon-button icon="polymer"></paper-icon-button>
</a>
```

### Styling

Style the button with CSS as you would a normal DOM element. If you are using the icons
provided by `iron-icons`, they will inherit the foreground color of the button.

```html
/* make a red "favorite" button */
<paper-icon-button icon="favorite" style="color: red;"></paper-icon-button>
```

By default, the ripple is the same color as the foreground at 25% opacity. You may
customize the color using the `--paper-icon-button-ink-color` custom property.

The following custom properties and mixins are available for styling:

| Custom property | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--paper-icon-button-disabled-text` | The color of the disabled button | `--disabled-text-color` |
| `--paper-icon-button-ink-color` | Selected/focus ripple color | `--primary-text-color` |
| `--paper-icon-button` | Mixin for a button | `{}` |
| `--paper-icon-button-disabled` | Mixin for a disabled button | `{}` |
| `--paper-icon-button-hover` | Mixin for button on hover | `{}` |
