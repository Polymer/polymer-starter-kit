##&lt;paper-material&gt;

Material design: [Cards](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/cards.html)

`paper-material` is a container that renders two shadows on top of each other to
create the effect of a lifted piece of paper.

Example:

```html
<paper-material elevation="1">
  ... content ...
</paper-material>
```
