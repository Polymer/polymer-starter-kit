  /**
   * The `<platinum-sw-fetch>` element creates custom [`fetch` event](https://slightlyoff.github.io/ServiceWorker/spec/service_worker/#fetch-event-section)
   * handlers for given URL patterns. Possible use cases include:
   *
   * - Using a special caching strategy for specific URLs.
   * - Returning static "fallback" responses instead of network errors when a remote API
   * is unavailable.
   *
   * In short, any scenario in which you'd like a service worker to intercept network
   * requests and provide custom response handling.
   *
   * If you'd like a single caching policy applied to all same-origin requests, then an alternative
   * to using `<platinum-sw-fetch>` is to use `<platinum-sw-cache>` with the `defaultCacheStategy`
   * property set.
   *
   * Under the hood, the [sw-toolbox](https://github.com/googlechrome/sw-toolbox) library is used
   * for all the request handling logic.
   *
   * `<platinum-sw-fetch>` needs to be a child element of `<platinum-sw-register>`.
   *
   * An example configuration is:
   *
   *     <platinum-sw-register auto-register>
   *       <platinum-sw-import-script href="custom-fetch-handler.js"></platinum-sw-import-script>
   *       <platinum-sw-fetch handler="customFetchHandler"
   *                          path="/(.*)/customFetch"></platinum-sw-fetch>
   *     </platinum-sw-register>
   *
   * This implies that there's a `custom-fetch-handler.js` file in the same directory as the current
   * page, which defines a `sw-toolbox` compliant
   * [request handler](https://github.com/googlechrome/sw-toolbox#request-handlers) named
   * `customFetchHandler`. This definition is imported using `<platinum-sw-import-script>`. The
   * `<platinum-sw-fetch>` element takes care of mapping which request paths are handled by
   * `customFetchHandler`.
   *
   * Anything not matching the `path` pattern is ignored by `<platinum-sw-fetch>`,
   * and it's possible to have multiple `<platinum-sw-fetch>` elements that each define different
   * paths and different handlers. The path matching is performed top-down, starting with the first
   * `<platinum-sw-fetch>` element.
   *
   * The `path` will, by default, only match same-origin requests. If you'd like to define a custom
   * handler for requests on a specific cross-origin domain, you must use the `origin` parameter
   * in conjunction with `path` to match the domains you'd like to handle.

       * By default, `path` will only match URLs under the current host (i.e. same-origin requests).
       * If you'd like to apply `handler` to cross-origin requests, then use `origin` to specify
       * which hosts will match. Setting `origin` is optional.
       *
       * `origin` is a `String`, but it is used internally to construct a
       * [`RegExp` object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions),
       * which is used for the matching.
       *
       * Note that the `origin` value will be matched against the full domain name and the protocol.
       * If you want to match  'http' and 'https', then use 'https?://' at the start of your string.
       *
       * Some examples:
       * - `origin="https?://.+\.google\.com"` → a RegExp that matches `http` or `https` requests
       *   made to any domain that ends in `.google.com`.
       * - `origin="https://www\.example\.com" → a RegExp that will only match `https` requests to
       *   one domain, `www.example.com`.

       * By default, `path` will only match same-origin URLs. If you'd like it to match
       * cross-origin URLs, use `path` in conjunction with `origin`.
       *
       * As explained in the
       * [`sw-toolbox` docs](https://github.com/googlechrome/sw-toolbox#toolboxrouterheadurlpattern-handler-options),
       * the URL path matching is done using the [`path-to-regexp`](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp)
       * module, which is the same logic used in [Express-style routing](http://expressjs.com/guide/routing.html).
       *
       * In practice, you need to always use '/' as the first character of your `path`, and then
       * can use '(.*)' as a wildcard.
       *
       * Some examples:
       * - `path="/(.*)/customFetch"` → matches any path that ends with '/customFetch'.
       * - `path="/customFetch(.*)"` → matches any path that starts with '/customFetch', optionally
       *   followed by other characters.
