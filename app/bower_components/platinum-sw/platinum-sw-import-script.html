  /**
   * The `<platinum-sw-import-script>` element is used to import a JavaScript file that is executed
   * each time the service worker starts up.
   *
   * `<platinum-sw-import-script>` needs to be a child element of `<platinum-sw-register>`.
   *
   * A common use case is to define a custom request handler for a `fetch` event, but it can be used
   * for any type of code that you want to be executed by the service worker.
   *
   *     <platinum-sw-register auto-register>
   *       <platinum-sw-import-script href="custom-fetch-handler.js"></platinum-sw-import-script>
   *       <platinum-sw-fetch handler="customFetchHandler"
   *                          path="/(.*)/customFetch"></platinum-sw-fetch>
   *     </platinum-sw-register>
   *
   * You can specify multiple `<platinum-sw-import-script>` elements, each one corresponding to a
   * different JavaScript file. The JavaScript files will be loaded in the order in which the
   * `<platinum-sw-import-script>` elements appear. Under the hood, this results in an
   * [`importScripts()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WorkerGlobalScope/importScripts)
   * call made from the context of the service worker.
