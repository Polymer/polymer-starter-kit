  /**
   * The `<platinum-sw-offline-analytics>` element registers a service worker handler to
   * intercepts requests for Google Analytics pings.
   *
   * If the HTTP GET for the ping is successful (because the browser is online), then everything
   * proceeds as it normally would. If the HTTP GET fails, the ping request is saved to IndexedDB, and each time the service worker
   * script starts up it will attempt to "replay" those saved ping requests, giving up after one day
   * has passed.
   *
   * The [`qt`](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/parameters#qt)
   * URL parameter is automatically added to the replayed HTTP GET and set to the number of
   * milliseconds that has passed since the initial ping request was attempted, to ensure that the
   * original time attribution is correct.
   *
   * `<platinum-sw-offline-analytics>` does not take care of setting up Google Analytics on your
   * page, and assumes that you have [properly configured](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008080)
   * Google Analytics tracking code registered elsewhere on your page.
   *
   * Since `<platinum-sw-offline-analytics>` is only useful if the page that is being tracked with
   * Google Analytics works offline, it's best used in conjunction with the `<platinum-sw-cache>`
   * element, which takes care of caching your site's resources and serving them while offline.
   *
   * A basic configuration is
   *
   *     <platinum-sw-register auto-register>
   *       <platinum-sw-offline-analytics></platinum-sw-offline-analytics>
   *       <platinum-sw-cache></platinum-sw-cache>
   *     </platinum-sw-register>
   *
