##&lt;paper-styles&gt;

The `<paper-styles>` component provides simple ways to use Material Design CSS styles
in your application. The following imports are available:

1. [color.html](https://github.com/PolymerElements/paper-styles/blob/master/color.html):
a complete list of the colors defined in the Material Design [palette](https://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html)


1. [default-theme.html](https://github.com/PolymerElements/paper-styles/blob/master/default-theme.html): text,
background and accent colors that match the default Material Design theme


1. [shadow.html](https://github.com/PolymerElements/paper-styles/blob/master/shadow.html): Material Design
[elevation](https://www.google.com/design/spec/what-is-material/elevation-shadows.html) and shadow styles


1. [typography.html](https://github.com/PolymerElements/paper-styles/blob/master/typography.html):
Material Design [font](http://www.google.com/design/spec/style/typography.html#typography-styles) styles and sizes


1. [demo-pages.html](https://github.com/PolymerElements/paper-styles/blob/master/demo-pages.html): generic styles
used in the PolymerElements demo pages



We recommend importing each of these individual files, and using the style mixins
available in each ones, rather than the aggregated `paper-styles.html` as a whole.
