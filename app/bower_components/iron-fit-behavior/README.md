##Polymer.IronFitBehavior

Polymer.IronFitBehavior fits an element in another element using `max-height` and `max-width`, and
optionally centers it in the window or another element.

The element will only be sized and/or positioned if it has not already been sized and/or positioned
by CSS.

| CSS properties | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `position` set | Element is not centered horizontally or vertically |
| `top` or `bottom` set | Element is not vertically centered |
| `left` or `right` set | Element is not horizontally centered |
| `max-height` or `height` set | Element respects `max-height` or `height` |
| `max-width` or `width` set | Element respects `max-width` or `width` |
