##&lt;paper-dialog&gt;

Material design: [Dialogs](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/dialogs.html)

`<paper-dialog>` is a dialog with Material Design styling and optional animations when it is
opened or closed. It provides styles for a header, content area, and an action area for buttons.
You can use the `<paper-dialog-scrollable>` element (in its own repository) if you need a scrolling
content area. See `Polymer.PaperDialogBehavior` for specifics.

For example, the following code implements a dialog with a header, scrolling content area and
buttons.

```html
<paper-dialog>
  <h2>Header</h2>
  <paper-dialog-scrollable>
    Lorem ipsum...
  </paper-dialog-scrollable>
  <div class="buttons">
    <paper-button dialog-dismiss>Cancel</paper-button>
    <paper-button dialog-confirm>Accept</paper-button>
  </div>
</paper-dialog>
```

### Styling

See the docs for `Polymer.PaperDialogBehavior` for the custom properties available for styling
this element.

### Animations

Set the `entry-animation` and/or `exit-animation` attributes to add an animation when the dialog
is opened or closed. See the documentation in
[PolymerElements/neon-animation](https://github.com/PolymerElements/neon-animation) for more info.

For example:

```html
<link rel="import" href="components/neon-animation/animations/scale-up-animation.html">
<link rel="import" href="components/neon-animation/animations/fade-out-animation.html">

<paper-dialog entry-animation="scale-up-animation"
              exit-animation="fade-out-animation">
  <h2>Header</h2>
  <div>Dialog body</div>
</paper-dialog>
```

### Accessibility

See the docs for `Polymer.PaperDialogBehavior` for accessibility features implemented by this
element.
