# Polymer App Toolbox - Starter Kit

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PolymerElements/polymer-starter-kit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PolymerElements/polymer-starter-kit)

This template is a starting point for building apps using a drawer-based
layout. The layout is provided by `app-layout` elements.

This template, along with the `polymer-cli` toolchain, also demonstrates use
of the "PRPL pattern" This pattern allows fast first delivery and interaction with
the content at the initial route requested by the user, along with fast subsequent
navigation by pre-caching the remaining components required by the app and
progressively loading them on-demand as the user navigates through the app.

The PRPL pattern, in a nutshell:

* **Push** components required for the initial route
* **Render** initial route ASAP
* **Pre-cache** components for remaining routes
* **Lazy-load** and progressively upgrade next routes on-demand

### Migrating from Polymer Starter Kit v1?

[Check out our blog post that covers what's changed in PSK2 and how to migrate!](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/blog/2016-08-18-polymer-starter-kit-or-polymer-cli.html)

### Quickstart

We've recorded a Polycast to get you up and running with PSK2 fast!

### Setup

##### Prerequisites

First, install [Polymer CLI](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-cli) using
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org)).

    npm install -g polymer-cli

Second, install [Bower](https://bower.io/) using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com)

    npm install -g bower

##### Initialize project from template

    mkdir my-app
    cd my-app
    polymer init polymer-2-starter-kit

### Start the development server

This command serves the app at `http://127.0.0.1:8081` and provides basic URL
routing for the app:

    polymer serve

### Build

The `polymer build` command builds your Polymer application for production, using build configuration options provided by the command line or in your project's `polymer.json` file.  

You can configure your `polymer.json` file to create multiple builds. This is necessary if you will be serving different builds optimized for different browsers. You can define your own named builds, or use presets. See the documentation on [building your project for production](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/toolbox/build-for-production) for more information.

The Polymer Starter Kit is configured to create three builds using [the three supported presets](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/toolbox/build-for-production#build-presets):

```
"builds": [
  {
    "preset": "es5-bundled"
  },
  {
    "preset": "es6-bundled"
  },
  {
    "preset": "es6-unbundled"
  }
]
```

Builds will be output to a subdirectory under the `build/` directory as follows:

```
build/
  es5-bundled/
  es6-bundled/
  es6-unbundled/
```

* `es5-bundled` is a bundled, minified build with a service worker. ES6 code is compiled to ES5 for compatibility with older browsers.
* `es6-bundled` is a bundled, minified build with a service worker. ES6 code is served as-is. This build is for browsers that can handle ES6 code - see [building your project for production](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/toolbox/build-for-production#compiling) for a list.
* `es6-unbundled` is an unbundled, minified build with a service worker. ES6 code is served as-is. This build is for browsers that support HTTP/2 push.

Run `polymer help build` for the full list of available options and optimizations. Also, see the documentation on the [polymer.json specification](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/docs/tools/polymer-json) and [building your Polymer application for production](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/toolbox/build-for-production).

### Preview the build

This command serves your app. Replace `build-folder-name` with the folder name of the build you want to serve.

    polymer serve build/build-folder-name

### Run tests

This command will run [Web Component Tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester)
against the browsers currently installed on your machine:

    polymer test

If running Windows you will need to set the following environment variables:

- LAUNCHPAD_BROWSERS
- LAUNCHPAD_CHROME

### Adding a new view

You can extend the app by adding more views that will be demand-loaded
e.g. based on the route, or to progressively render non-critical sections of the
application. Each new demand-loaded fragment should be added to the list of
`fragments` in the included `polymer.json` file. This will ensure those
components and their dependencies are added to the list of pre-cached components
and will be included in a bundled build.
