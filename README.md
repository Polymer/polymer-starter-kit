# Polymer App Toolbox - Starter Kit

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PolymerElements/polymer-starter-kit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PolymerElements/polymer-starter-kit)

This template is a starting point for building apps using a drawer-based
layout. The layout is provided by `app-layout` elements.

This template, along with the `polymer-cli` toolchain, also demonstrates use
of the "PRPL pattern" This pattern allows fast first delivery and interaction with
the content at the initial route requested by the user, along with fast subsequent
navigation by pre-caching the remaining components required by the app and
progressively loading them on-demand as the user navigates through the app.

The PRPL pattern, in a nutshell:

* **Push** components required for the initial route
* **Render** initial route ASAP
* **Pre-cache** components for remaining routes
* **Lazy-load** and progressively upgrade next routes on-demand

### Migrating from Polymer Starter Kit v1?

[Check out our blog post that covers what's changed in PSK2 and how to migrate!](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/blog/2016-08-18-polymer-starter-kit-or-polymer-cli.html)

### Quickstart

We've recorded a Polycast to get you up and running with PSK2 fast!

### Setup

##### Prerequisites

First, install [Polymer CLI](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-cli) using
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org)).

    npm install -g polymer-cli

Second, install [Bower](https://bower.io/) using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com)

    npm install -g bower

##### Initialize project from template

    mkdir my-app
    cd my-app
    polymer init polymer-2-starter-kit

### Start the development server

This command serves the app at `http://127.0.0.1:8081` and provides basic URL
routing for the app:

    polymer serve

### Build

This command builds your Polymer application for production. The `polymer build` command has options that support optimizations like code bundling, minification, and ES6 compilation to run on older browsers. 

By default, most of these optimizations are disabled, and your build is output into the `build/default` folder.

To enable build optimizations, you can use command line options. For example, the following command builds a minified, bundled project:

    polymer build --js-minify --css-minify --html-minify --bundle

To make sure the correct build enhancements are always used, you can provide a set of build configurations via the "builds" field of your polymer.json file, like this:

    "builds": [{
      "bundle": true,
      "js": {"minify": true},
      "css": {"minify": true},
      "html": {"minify": true}
    }],

Run `polymer help build` for the full list of available options and optimizations. Also, see the documentation on the [polymer.json specification](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/docs/tools/polymer-json) and [building your Polymer application for production](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/toolbox/build-for-production).

### Preview the build

This command serves your app and opens a browser for you to view it: 

    polymer serve --open

### Run tests

This command will run [Web Component Tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester)
against the browsers currently installed on your machine:

    polymer test

If running Windows you will need to set the following environment variables:

- LAUNCHPAD_BROWSERS
- LAUNCHPAD_CHROME

### Adding a new view

You can extend the app by adding more views that will be demand-loaded
e.g. based on the route, or to progressively render non-critical sections of the
application. Each new demand-loaded fragment should be added to the list of
`fragments` in the included `polymer.json` file. This will ensure those
components and their dependencies are added to the list of pre-cached components
and will be included in a bundled build.
